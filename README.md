# RSCore
RubenSystems STL for Mac and Lunix

Designed as a lightweight and performant STL for projects that require easy customisation of and additions to standard features. 

It is header only and namespaced so if you wish to use it, git clone and #include "file you want". 


### Implemented features: 

- Allocator. Allocates contiguious blocks without calling (con/de)structors (be careful) 
- Array. Like a vector in c++  
- Text. Like a string in c++
